## Aether Link
Aether Link is a qualitty of life tool, designed to unified the modding expereince in `Final Fantasy XIV`, providing modders with a centralized hub with all of their tools.

### The Problem
Lets face it, modding is a pain the butt, and no one seems to be addressing the simple issues that the community has complaints about. This project is aimed to assit and to resolve the complains I have heard. With this project, you can look forward to **organization of your mods**, **accessibiltiy features** and **patreon integrations** with mod creators.
